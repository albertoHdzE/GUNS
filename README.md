## Explanation [here](https://sites.google.com/view/complexai/guns)

[MEXICA](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09528130010029820) is the implementation of a model of the cognitive process that has been used originally to create histories as a writer would do alternating between two theoretical estates: engagement and reflection, this is a first state of generation of ideas and a second process logical construction of such ideas, this is, based on the [Piaget's theory if cognitive development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhcgYgx7aAA&list=PL3R6M6jfekM6IC-MmUvCzoiyvS519o_uu&index=22&ab_channel=Sprouts)

Guns itâ€™s a video game which, using this model of the creativity process as artificial intelligence implementation, tries to win a match against a human player in a strategy video game style (RTS or Real Time Strategy). At running time, the A.I. build a game strategy using previous experience collected of a experimentation phase with human players, whose information was processed and saved in text files.
Guns then is a dynamic environment whose updates adapts  and control a team composed by 3 different agents with different and specific features in order to win the match.
